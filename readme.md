# Smallsh -- Fischer Jemison

This is a shell program created for the Operating Systems I class at Oregon State University. It features signal handling, process management, outside program management, and more.

To compile, just run `make`. If you don't have unix make, then just open Makefile and run the command from the default target. 

Once compiled, just run `./smallsh` to start the shell.
